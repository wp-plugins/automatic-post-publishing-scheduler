Publishes posts according to a pre-defined schedule.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to define time slots when your posts will be published.  With this plugin enabled, when an author presses the 'Publish' button in the post editor, the post will not be published 'now', but rather in the first available defined time slot.  Do you have multiple authors writing on your blog and you need to keep their posts spaced out?  Do you wish to keep your content fresh during optimal times?  This plugin is for you.

If all of the slots for 'today' are already filled up, the scheduler will move to tomorrow and try to find a slot there and so on.
 

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
